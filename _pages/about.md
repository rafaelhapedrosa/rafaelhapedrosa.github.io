I am a neuroscientist ðŸ§  with 10+ years in **memory, sleep and neurotech**. I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the **University College London** (London, UK), where I am studying how the maturation of hippocampo-cortical circuits works as a cognitive modulator during childhood to adulthood. Previous to this, I worked as a postdoc at **University of Cambridge** (Cambridge, UK), investigating how we use our gaze ðŸ‘€ to build our cognitive map. I completed my PhD at **Donders Institute** (Nijmegen, The Netherlands) in the lab of Prof. Francesco Battaglia and co-mentored by Prof. Federico Stella. Together, we investigated how and where memories are consolidated in the brain during awake (encoding and resting state) and sleep ðŸ˜´. 

In general, my work integrates advanced data analysis, machine learning, and innovative hardware development to uncover insights into sleep and memory processes. 

In my free time, I like to spend time with family and friends, playing music, reading and watching my football teams Flamengo and ABC/RN.
